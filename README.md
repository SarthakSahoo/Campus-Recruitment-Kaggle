# Campus-Recruitment-Kaggle

This work is based on Campus Recruitement Dataset from Kaggle. This data set consists of Placement data of students in a XYZ campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students. 

Data exploration, Classification and Regression analysis of the data is done with the help of Python and different Libraries.

## Python Libraries Used:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn

## Classification Analysis:
In the classification analysis; we have used different parameters to know if a candidate will secure the job or not. The different Classification model used in this work are:
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression

## Regression Analysis:
In Regression analysis; the goal was to predict the salary of candidate based on different parameters of the dataset. The different Regression model used are:
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree

## Feature Scaling & Label Encoding:
Before using the data for analysis; there has been many categorical values which are encoded using LabelEncoder() and numerical value scaling was done through StandardScaler() of scikit-learn.
